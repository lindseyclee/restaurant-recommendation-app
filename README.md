**App Title:** GrubGuide

**Course:** CPSC 357 - iOS App Development (Swift)

## Overview:

GrubGuide is a SwiftUI app that helps users discover restaurants based on preferences like city, cuisine, rating, price range, and availability of online delivery or table booking. Users can get personalized recommendations and save their favorites, as well as explore all options around the world. This app is great for when traveling abroad.

## Features:

- Filter restaurants by city, cuisine, rating, price, delivery availability, and booking availability.
- Advanced Feature: Save/unsave favorites with double-tap gesture on heart icons that sends them to the Favorites tab.
- Dark mode toggle available in Settings.
- Get recommendations based on a sample dataset.

## How to Run:

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Build and run the app on a simulator or device.
3. Use the GrubGuide tab to select preferences and get restaurant recommendations.
4. Access the Favorites tab to view saved restaurants.
5. Explore the full list of data in the search page.
6. Change appearance settings in the Settings tab.

## Additional Notes:

- The sample restaurant dataset is included in the project in .json format.
- Double-tap on the heart icon to add or remove favorites.
- Since the app is centered around a dataset, getting a recommendation in GrubGuide from the user data can be very specific. I would suggest selecing New Delhi (city) and American (cuisine) to test. That input has more variety to test.
- Refer to demo.mp4 for a video demonstration on how the app works!
